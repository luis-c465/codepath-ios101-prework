### When 2 Meet v2  
An idea for a mobile app that I have is a replica of when too meet but that allows people to submit their times for meeting withought needing to sign in.
It would allow users to create an account and then set possible dates and times for when too meet. Then give a link to share with others to fill in their availible time either through the web or mobile app. 
When others fill in their times, in real time it should update the UI to display the new data.
Finally the user who created the time sheet can lock the event preventing further sumbissions allowing them and all users with the link to view the most availible times.
